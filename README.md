# ActorCatalogue

A SpringBoot [https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/](SpringBoot) sample application that retrieves and stores movie actor information. The domain is trivial so we can showcase SpringBoot's capabilities



It demonstrates the following SpringBoot capabilities:

- Setting up a SpringBoot project
- Writing a simple REST controller
- Adding JPA capabilities
- Adding Caching
- Adding production monitoring through Actuator
- Writing Integration tests for the application
- Setting up SpringBoot dev tools
- Using the SpringBoot maven plugin to repackage the application into a runnable JAR
- Adding the admin client so the application can use a SpringBoot AdminServer

All these steps are represented through Git commits so you can check out any step you want and build from there.
